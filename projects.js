            description: "The OpenGL Renderer project, completed between March and May 2024, involved developing an advanced OpenGL renderer capable of rendering complex 3D scenes. The primary objective was to create an efficient rendering pipeline that could handle dynamic lighting, shadows, and multiple textures. This project served as a deep dive into graphics programming using C++ and OpenGL, where I learned how to effectively implement shaders, manage vertex data, and optimize rendering for real-time performance. \n Throughout the project, Visual Studio was used as the main IDE for writing, debugging, and refining the code. By leveraging its debugging tools, I was able to overcome issues such as memory leaks and inefficient rendering loops, which greatly improved the renderer's overall performance. \n Github was critical for version control, allowing me to track my progress and manage the various iterations of the renderer as I implemented new features like lighting models and texture mapping. This provided an excellent opportunity to practice industry-standard workflows such as branching, committing, and merging code changes. \n The project not only improved my knowledge of 3D rendering techniques but also solidified my understanding of C++ in high-performance computing environments. It challenged me to think critically about optimization and resource management, which are essential when dealing with real-time graphics.",

I created features like player movement, obstacle spawning, and trigger-based events, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay. \n Through this process, I gained a solid understanding of how Unreal Engine handles game mechanics, asset management, and performance optimization. Visual scripting provided a highly accessible way to experiment with different gameplay ideas and refine the overall experience without the overhead of writing code. \n The experience I gained from working on Sky Patrol allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of how to organize and execute game logic efficiently.
